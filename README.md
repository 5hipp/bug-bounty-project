# bug-bounty-project

the following is a project that I started in my final year of unviersity and plan to work towards through the future.

at its core, the website will be a host for a number of areas of cyber security, prodominantly a place for people to learn and educate 
themselves on the world of cyber security, but also a place for people to push their skills and further their knowledge, with the 
appeal of bounties and prizes infront of them.

below a number of proof of concept screenshots can be found.
